 <p> My name is Jorge Molina and I am a sophomore at Santa Ana High School. I took Stem in 6th grade and I am currently in Cstem. I am also a Certified Inventor user and I decided to take this course because I aspire to be an engineer and this course can help me become one. Some of my hobbies include biking, playing water polo, swimming, and reading. </p>
